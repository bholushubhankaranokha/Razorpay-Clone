# Razorpay Clone 💳

A responsive front-end clone of the Razorpay website built using HTML, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.  
This project replicates the modern UI design and layout structure of the original platform for learning and practice purposes.

## 📌 About The Project

This project focuses on recreating the user interface of Razorpay with pixel-perfect accuracy and responsive design principles.  

It helped me strengthen my understanding of:
- Utility-first styling with Tailwind CSS  
- Responsive web design  
- Layout structuring using Flexbox  
- Clean and scalable front-end architecture  

The goal was to replicate a real-world production-level website and improve attention to design details.
